# CSharpOutline2019

Adds curly braces outlining for C# editor, especially the braces in catch & finally.  Need to disable built-in outlining of Visual Studio.

>Tools-Option-Text Editor-C#-Advanced-Outlining, uncheck 'Show outlining of declaration level constructs' and 'Show outlining of code level constructs'

All the code comes from https://github.com/Skybladev2/C--outline-for-Visual-Studio , with some minor change.
